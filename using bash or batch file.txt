One approach is to use a file dialog library like tkinter in Python 
to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to select a file. 
Example to achieve this using tkinter in Python:

python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog

root = tk.Tk()
root.withdraw()

file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(filetypes=[("Python files", "*.py")])

if file_path:
*Run the selected Python file*
    command = f"python3 {file_path}"
*Execute the command using the appropriate method based on operating system*

*For example, on Windows, use the `os.system` function:*
*import os*
*os.system(command)*

*On Unix-based systems, use the `subprocess` module:*
    import subprocess
    subprocess.run(command, shell=True)


This code will open a file dialog that allows to select a Python file with a .py extension. 
select a file and click "Open," 
the code will construct a command to run the selected Python file using python3
then execute this command using the appropriate method based on operating system.

The specific implementation may vary depending on the requirements and the operating system.
