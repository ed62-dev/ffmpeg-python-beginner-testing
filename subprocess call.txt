It is possible to have a button in a Python GUI, 
trigger the execution of another Python script. 
You can achieve this by using the subprocess module 
to call the Python code that you want to run when the button is clicked.

Example of how you can accomplish this 
using the subprocess module:

python
import subprocess
import tkinter as tk

def run_program():
    subprocess.call(["python", "my_other_python_program.py"])

root = tk.Tk()
button = tk.Button(root, text='Run My Program', command=run_program)
button.pack()

root.mainloop()

In this example, when the button is clicked, 
the run_program function is called, 
which in turn uses subprocess.call to execute 
the other Python script named "my_other_python_program.py".

This approach allows to keep the functionality 
of the second Python script separate 
and trigger its execution from the main GUI script 
without the need to rewrite the code.

Here, replace "my_other_python_program.py" with 
the actual filename of the Python script you want to run.

The subprocess module can effectively trigger 
the execution of another Python script from GUI 
without the need to rewrite your existing code.
